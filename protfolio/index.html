                <h3>Unsupervised machine learning for managing safety accidents in railway stations</h3>
                <p>This project aims to leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques to enhance safety management in railway stations by analyzing and preventing safety accidents.
                     Railway stations are high-traffic environments where accidents can lead to significant disruptions and safety risks.
                      By applying algorithms like clustering and anomaly detection, the project seeks to identify hidden patterns and trends within accident data, such as recurring locations, times, and contributing factors.

                <h3>Machine learning for web vulnerability detection </h3>
                <p>Machine learning (ML) for web vulnerability detection is an emerging approach that leverages algorithms and models to automatically identify security weaknesses in web applications. Traditional methods of detecting vulnerabilities often rely on manual testing or predefined rules, but ML techniques can enhance this by analyzing large datasets of web traffic, code, and known attack patterns to uncover previously unknown vulnerabilities. 
                    By training models on historical security incidents and behavior patterns, ML systems can classify and predict potential threats, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other exploits.
